# Zed Universe is a community and creative space for feedback, development and learning.

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all participants so we can indulge our curiosity with total freedom.

This code of conduct applies to the entire arena of Zed Universe, including the Discord server, issues and discussions on Github, and other areas related to Zed's operations, both online and off. We reserve the right to exclude anyone from these spaces if they're engaging in harmful behavior.

## What's not okay? 

Conduct that interferes with another member's ability to learn and grow. This stuff is not acceptable:

- Offensive comments related to gender (including identity and expression), sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
- Initiating unwanted and inappropriate social contact.
- Gratuitous or off-topic discussion of a sexual nature.
- Threatening violence or trying to incite it.
- Deliberate intimidation and disruption, including stalking and following.

We will prioritize safety and the comfort of the people in our community over openness â€“ Zed Universe is a private space run by Zed Industries. We won't hesitate to remove offensive or combative content, and exclude people from the space that insist on pushing against the rules.

If you're experiencing any of the above in this community, notice it happening to someone else, or have any other safety-related concerns, please contact [nate@zed.dev](mail-to:nate@zed.dev). If you need an alternate point of contact you can reach out to [max@zed.dev](mail-to:max@zed.dev).

We will respond to you as quickly as possible, respect confidentiality requests, and take all good-faith reports of harassment seriously.
